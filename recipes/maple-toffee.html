                <li>Maple syrup (as needed)</li>
                <li>Fresh snow</li>
                <li>Cold water</li>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather fresh snow in a pan. Pack down until solid.</li>
                <li>Boil maple syrup over high heat until it reaches a rolling boil.</li>
                <li>Pour cold water into a glass. Using a spoon, carefully drop some maple syrup into the water. The syrup is ready once it reaches the "soft ball" stage. Once in the water, maple syrup should be able to stick together (or rolled between fingers to form a soft, tacky ball).</li>
                <li>Carefully drizzle maple syrup in strips (roughly 1 inch wide) along the snow. Press a stick into one end of the syrup, wait a few seconds, and roll up the maple syrup.</li>
                <li>Peel the maple syrup off the snow and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
